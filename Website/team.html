									<h3>Joshua Abraham <span class="image right"><img src="resources/abraham.jpg" alt="" /></span> </h3>
									<p><i>Chief Implementor</i></p>
									<p>
										Joshua joined Computer Science on a split second decision and hasn't regretted it since.
										He completed his Undergrad in Physics (which was his first choice) and Computer Science at the University of the Western Cape.
										He then went off-grid for some time to pursue personal interests and better himself as a human being, after relocating from city to farm life.
										After about a year he heard the city calling him back to complete an Honours in Computer Science at the University of Cape Town.
										His future plans are quite confidential, not even known to himself. However, one thing he does know: there is nothing he can't
										acheive, given time and some rooibos tea.

										Thomas knew computer science was the field for him since high school. It has enabled him to probelm solve
										and create cool projects. He completed a Bachelor of Science at the University of Cape Town majoring in
										Mathematics and Computer Science. He is now completing his Honours in Computer Science at the University of Cape Town.
										His future endeavours are mostly unknown, however, he aims to follow his passions and make an impact in the world.
