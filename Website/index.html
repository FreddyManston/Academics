                                The aim of the project is to implement an ontology editing environment for a form of non-classical
                                reasoning known as preferential reasoning. Preferential reasoning is a logical system, based on classical
                                reasoning, that is able to deal with inconsistent ontologies in a systematic and well defined manner.
                                The system needs to allow the user to assign rankings to statements (based on exceptionality) and take
                                these rankings into account when querying the knowledge base. This system would provide a basis for
                                intelligent systems that are capable of dealing with preference.

                                    The core of the theory section is a set of theorems detailing various characteristics of user-defined rankings. A more detailed overview can be found on the <a href="theory.html">Theory</a> page.

                                    <i>Rational closure</i> is an algorithm designed by Lehmann and Magidor<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup> to satisfy a set of postulates known as the KLM postulates and rational monotonicity, defined by Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup> and motivated to be rules that any rational non-monotonic reasoning system <i>should</i> satisfy. Rational closure automatically computes a ranking of statements for use in reasoning. A theorem presented in the paper, however, shows that the KLM postulates and rational monotonicity hold when reasoning with an arbitrary ranking of statements:<br/><br/>

                                    <div class="theorem head">Theorems 4.5 &amp; 4.6:</div>
                                    <div class="theorem">Any user-defined ranking satisfies the KLM postulates and rational monotonicity.</div>
                                    <br/>
                                    In the paper, dense rankings are defined, which are essentially user-defined rankings with the property that no two adjacent ranks are equivalent. It is shown that every user-defined ranking has an equivalent dense ranking, and an algorithm is given for finding this. A result is then presented about when two dense rankings entail the same set of statements: only when they have the same number of ranks, and corresponding ranks are equivalent. <br/><br/>

                                    <div class="theorem head">Theorem 5.11</div>
                                    <div class="theorem">Two dense rankings are equivalent if and only if they have the same number of ranks, and corresponding ranks are equivalent</div>
                                    <br/>

                                    Following this, the redundancy of statements in a ranking is discussed; in other words, identifying when statements can be removed from a ranking without effecting the set of statements it entails. A statement is <i>locally redundant</i> for a given rank if that rank is the same with or without the statement. A statement is <i>totally redundant</i> if it can be removed from the entire ranking without effecting the set of entailed statements. It is shown that for dense rankings, these can be related, because a statement is locally redundant at the highest rank at which it is present if and only if it is totally redundant.<br/><br/>

                                    <div class="theorem head">Theorem 6.4</div>
                                    <div class="theorem">A statement is totally redundant if and only if it is locally redundant at the highest rank at which it is present</div>
                                    <br/>

                                    The last core result of the paper is a result showing that Lehmann and Magidor's rational closure is essentially equivalent to reasoning with user-defined rankings, because given the right inputs, rankings can simulate rational closure, and rational closure can simulate any rankings.

                                    Defeasible Datalog was implemented as a wrapper for the <a href=http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/isg/tools/RDFox/> RDFox system</a>.
                                    RDFox is an RDF triple store that allows for classical datalog reasoning. 
                                    It was chosen for its efficiency and its incredible materialisation capabilities.
                                    It was possible to use RDFox in this project due to the way that the Rational Closure algorithm
                                    elegantly turns a defeasible inference check into a series of classical inference checks, 
                                    by means of ranking the knowledge base according to exceptionality.

                                    In order to represent defeasible statements/rules classical datalog had to be extended to allow for negation.
                                    This was done by adding a standard negation atom to the datalog language. Using this, a datalog rule to represent that penguins don't fly
                                    would be written as: <i>&lthttp://defeasibledatalog.org/hons/negation#False&gt :- &lthttp://animal#Penguin&gt(?X), &lthttp://ability#Fly&gt(?X)</i>

                                    <div class="subheading"><h5>Ranking Statements</h5></div>
                                    The defeasible statements in the knowledge base are ranked according to exceptionality. A statement is said to be exceptional
                                    if its antecedent doesn't produce a clash or contradiction in the current knowledge. Defeasible statements are ranked from lowest
                                    exceptionality to highest. The last rank consists of all the classical statements (i.e. unexceptional), as well as those
                                    defeasible statements that are found to be implicitly unexceptional.

                                    Once all the defeasible statments are ranked, queries are performed by checking whether or not they are in the Rational Closure of the knowledge base.
                                    A query is said to be in the Rational Closure if it can be found in the materialisation of any of the subsets of the knowledge base.
                                    Subsets are created by, starting with the entire knowledge base, iteratively removing the current lowest rank until the query can be satisfied or only the last rank (i.e. the infinite rank) remains.
                                    The syntax of queries should conform to the syntax of our extended datalog.

                                We were able to enhance Datalog to allow for defeasible reasoning. This was done using an adaptation of the rational closure algorithm. 
                                We were able to show that our adaptation is theoretically sound. 
                                We were also able to implement our adaptation using RDFox and showed its correctness with test cases.
