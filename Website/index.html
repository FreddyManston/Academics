                              Datalog is the programming language we have chosen for our project. It is a syntactical subset of Prolog, however
                              unlike Prolog, statements may be evaluated in any order, finite statement sets are guaranteed to terminate and
                              Datalog does not contain Prolog's cut operator. These differences make Datalog a fully declarative programming language.
                              Furthermore, there are other restrictions that limit the expressivity of Datalog. Datalog is often used as a querying
                              language for deductive databases as a result of allowing for efficient query resolution algorithms. This gives it wider
                              application in security, program analysis, networking, cloud computing, information extraction and data integration. Despite this,
                              the restrictions placed on Datalog limit its application in other areas. There exist several extensions of Datalog to address these
                              limitations and our project plans to construct another extension that will allow it to handle defeasible reasoning.
                              <br><br>
                              Defeasible reasoning falls under non-monotonic logic - a form of logic that allows for the retraction of previously stated claims.
                              Specifically, defeasible reasoning allows for contingent claims. That is, defeasible reasoning allows one to make a claim that may be
                              incomplete and may be retracted given new claims. In this way, it awknowledges fallibility and corrigibility of claims.
                              <br><br>
                              Datalog does not possess the expressivity to handle refeasible reasoning. We aim to construct an extension of Datalog with
                              defeasible reasoning called Defeasible Datalog. We hope this will encourage more systems to handle contingent claims, such
                              as there importance in decision making.

                                    Defeasible Datalog was implemented as a wrapper for the <a href=http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/isg/tools/RDFox/> RDFox system</a>.
                                    RDFox is an RDF triple store that allows for classical datalog reasoning. 
                                    It was chosen for its efficiency and its incredible materialisation capabilities.
                                    It was possible to use RDFox in this project due to the way that the Rational Closure algorithm
                                    elegantly turns a defeasible inference check into a series of classical inference checks, 
                                    by means of ranking the knowledge base according to exceptionality.

                                    In order to represent defeasible statements/rules classical datalog had to be extended to allow for negation.
                                    This was done by adding a standard negation atom to the datalog language. Using this, a datalog rule to represent that penguins don't fly
                                    would be written as: <i>&lthttp://defeasibledatalog.org/hons/negation#False&gt :- &lthttp://animal#Penguin&gt(?X), &lthttp://ability#Fly&gt(?X)</i>

                                    <div class="subheading"><h5>Ranking Statements</h5></div>
                                    The defeasible statements in the knowledge base are ranked according to exceptionality. A statement is said to be exceptional
                                    if its antecedent doesn't produce a clash or contradiction in the current knowledge. Defeasible statements are ranked from lowest
                                    exceptionality to highest. The last rank consists of all the classical statements (i.e. unexceptional), as well as those
                                    defeasible statements that are found to be implicitly unexceptional.

                                    <div class="subheading"><h5>Performing Queries</h5></div>
                                    Once all the defeasible statments are ranked, queries are performed by checking whether or not they are in the Rational Closure of the knowledge base.
                                    A query is said to be in the Rational Closure if it can be found in the materialisation of any of the subsets of the knowledge base.
                                    Subsets are created by, starting with the entire knowledge base, iteratively removing the current lowest rank until the query can be satisfied or only the last rank (i.e. the infinite rank) remains.
                                    The syntax of queries should conform to the syntax of our extended datalog.

                                  We were able to enhance Datalog to allow for defeasible reasoning. This was done using
                                  an adaptation of the rational closure algorithm. We were able to show that our adaptation
                                  is theoretically sound. We were also able to implement our adaptation using RDFox and showed
                                  its correctness with test cases.
