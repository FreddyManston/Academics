									<h2>Description</h2>
									<p>
										Datalog is the declarative programming language we have chosen for our project. It is a syntactical subset of Prolog. However
										unlike Prolog, statements may be evaluated in any order, finite statement sets are guaranteed to terminate and
										Datalog does not contain Prolog's cut operator. These differences make Datalog a fully declarative programming language.
										Furthermore, there are other restrictions that limit the expressivity of Datalog. Datalog is often used as a querying
										language for deductive databases as a result of allowing for efficient query resolution algorithms. This gives it wider
										application in security, program analysis, networking, cloud computing, information extraction and data integration. Despite this,
										the restrictions placed on Datalog limit its application in other areas. There exist several extensions of Datalog to address these
										limitations and our project plans to construct another extension that will allow it to handle defeasible reasoning.
										<br><br>
										Defeasible reasoning falls under non-monotonic logic - a form of logic that allows for the retraction of previously stated claims.
										Specifically, defeasible reasoning allows for contingent claims. That is, defeasible reasoning allows one to make a claim that may be
										incomplete and may be retracted given new claims. In this way, it awknowledges fallibility and corrigibility of claims. Defeasible reasoning
										is important in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and finds its fullest expression in knowledge representation and planning.
										<br><br>
										Datalog does not possess the expressivity to handle refeasible reasoning. Our project aim to construct an extension of Datalog with
										defeasible reasoning called Defeasible Datalog. Our project is split into two main parts:
										<ol>
										  	<li>the theoretical construction of Defeasible Datalog as well as the proof for theoretical correctness. </li>
											<li>the implementation of Defeasible Datalog as a proof of concept. </li>
										</ol>
										Both parts will be discussed in more detail below and in full detail in the linked papers. We hope that our project will encourage more systems to
										handle defeasible reasoning, such as is its importance in AI.

									<h2>Theory</h2>
									<p>
										In order to construct Defeasible Datalog we first decided upon the procedure for which defeasible reasoning will
										be done. The algorithm we aim to use is known as the Rational Closure algorithm. However, in order to use this
										algorithm we need to enhance the expressivity of Datalog. In particular, we require Datalog to handle rules that
										may use negation and disjunction.
										<br><br>
										<div class="subheading"><h5>Syntax and Semantics</h5></div>
										With these requirements in mind, we analysed the current syntax and semantics of Datalog using a bottom-up
										approach. Using this analysis we constructing the syntax and semantics of Defeasible Datalog, again using a
										bottom-up approach. This allowed us to incorporate negation and disjunction into Datalog rules.
										<br><br>
										<div class="subheading"><h5>Rational Closure</h5></div>
										Once the syntax and semantics of Defeasible Datalog were constructed we needed to address the Rational
										Closure algorithm. There are many descriptions of the Rational Closure algorithm, however, we needed to
										adapt it for Defeasible Datalog. Furthermore, the Rational Closure algorithm requires a procedure for
										ranking the defeasible statements in order to work. Below we show our adapted Rational Closure algorithm
										as well as our Exceptionality Ranking algorithm.

										<br><br>

										<br><br>


										Now that we have defined our Rational Closure algorithm we will now be able to handle reasoning with both
										classical and defeasible Datalog rules. We are able to do this by making the defeasible rules into
										classical rules and ranking them according to exceptionality. Then when presented with a query we are
										able to reason using a number of classical entailment checks.
										<br><br>
										<div class="subheading"><h5>KLM Postulates</h5></div>
										It was stated in the literature that in order for a procedure to be a reasonable non-monotonic reasoner it
										must satisfy a number of properties. These properties define what is known as a rational relation.

										<br><br>
										<!--Properties-->
										<div class="justify-content-center" style="text-align:center">
										<img width="40%" style="padding-right: 10px;" src="resources/properties.png">
										</div>
										<br><br>

										For us to be satisfied with our construction of Defeasible Datalog we must show that our definition
										of Rational Closure reflected a rational relation. That is it possessed each of the properties above.
										Fortunately, we were able to show that our Rational Closure algorithm does in fact satisfy these properties.
										Thus our construction of Defeasible Datalog is complete.

										<h2>Implementation</h2>
										<p>
											Defeasible Datalog was implemented as a wrapper for the <a href=http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/isg/tools/RDFox/> RDFox system</a>.
											RDFox is an RDF triple store that allows for classical datalog reasoning.
											It was chosen for its efficiency and its incredible materialisation capabilities.
		                                    It was possible to use RDFox in this project due to the way that the Rational Closure algorithm
		                                    elegantly turns a defeasible inference check into a series of classical inference checks,
		                                    by means of ranking the knowledge base according to exceptionality.
		                                    <br/><br/>

		                                    <div class="subheading"><h5>Extending Datalog</h5></div>
		                                    In order to represent defeasible statements/rules classical datalog had to be extended to allow for negation.
		                                    This was done by adding a standard negation atom to the datalog language. Using this, a datalog rule to represent that penguins don't fly
		                                    would be written as: 
		                                    <pre><code><i>&lthttp://defeasibledatalog.org/hons/negation#False&gt :- &lthttp://animal#Penguin&gt(?X), &lthttp://ability#Fly&gt(?X)</i></code></pre>
		                                    <br/><br/>

		                                    <div class="subheading"><h5>Ranking Statements</h5></div>
		                                    The defeasible statements in the knowledge base are ranked according to exceptionality. A statement is said to be exceptional
		                                    if its antecedent doesn't produce a clash or contradiction in the current knowledge. Defeasible statements are ranked from lowest
		                                    exceptionality to highest. The last rank consists of all the classical statements (i.e. unexceptional), as well as those
		                                    defeasible statements that are found to be implicitly unexceptional.
		                                    (insert pictures)
		                                    <br/><br/>

		                                    <div class="subheading"><h5>Performing Queries</h5></div>
		                                    Once all the defeasible statments are ranked, queries are performed by checking whether or not they are in the Rational Closure of the knowledge base.
		                                    A query is said to be in the Rational Closure if it can be found in the materialisation of any of the subsets of the knowledge base.
		                                    Subsets are created by, starting with the entire knowledge base, iteratively removing the current lowest rank until the query can be satisfied or only the last rank (i.e. the infinite rank) remains.
		                                    The syntax of queries should conform to the syntax of our extended datalog.
		                                    (insert pictures)

										<h2>Results</h2>
										<p>
										A few examples of the output of our Defeasible Datalog reasoner are given here. The format of the outputs are:
											<ol>
												<li>The imported knowledge base, with a seperation between the classical and defeasible statements. </li>
												<li>The amount of time it took to rank the knowledge base, along with the final result of ranking the knowledge base. </li>
												<li>A few queries to the ranked knowledge base, in datalog syntax, along with the answer to those queries. </li>
											</ol>
											These outputs can be obtained by testing the Defeasible Datalog reasoner against the provided test cases (all of which can be found in the GitHub repo) and are numbered accordingly.
											They are as follows:

										<h2>Conclusion</h2>
										<p>
											We set out to construct Defeasible Datalog, a declarative programming language for reasoning with defeasible statements.
											We achieved this. Our achievement can be split up in two parts:
											<ol>
												<li>We showed that we could theoretically construct such a language. This was done
												by enhancing the syntax and semantics of Datalog. Adapting the Rational Closure algorithm to be used as our
												reasoning procedure. Showing that our Rational Closure algorithm represents a rational relation, making it a
												reasonable procedure for non-monotonic reasoning. </li>
												<li>We were able to construct a proof of concept. This was
												done by extending RDFox with our syntax as well as implementing our Rational Closure algorithm as part of the
												reasoning procedure. </li>
